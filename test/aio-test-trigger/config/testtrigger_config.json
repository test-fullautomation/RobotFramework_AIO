# Section "COMPONENTS":
# ---------------------
#
# It is assumed that "TESTFOLDER" is a subfolder of "COMPONENTROOTPATH" and that "TESTEXECUTOR" (the name only) is placed inside "TESTFOLDER"!
# "TESTTYPE" has to be one of ['ROBOT', 'PYTEST']
# It is assumed that "COMPONENTROOTPATH" does exist.
# The complete path of "LOGFILE" is being created by the test executors.
#
# The key "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is optional; other keys of section "COMPONENTS" are mandatory.
# The meaning of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is: Command line part that is only valid for a certain test folder, but not for all test executions.
# The content of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is a list. Elements of this list can be parameters (${...}).
# Values for parameters that are part of the "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" list, have to be defined in command line of Test Trigger (with --params).
# Example: --params "param1=value1;param2=value2;...". This is optional.
# Parameters of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" that are not defined in command line, are skipped and therefore are not considered for test execution.
# Finally (after internally the parameters are resolved) the "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" only contains parameters that are defined in the command line.
#
# In case of the "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" of a component contains a relative path, this path has to be relative to the position of the component,
# who works with this path (and not relative to the position of the Test Trigger or this config file). The Test Triger does not resolve
# relative paths inside "LOCALCOMMANDLINE".
#
# It is assumed that every value inside --params can be a string containing blanks. Nevertheless it is not necessary to encapsulate values in quotes.
# The Test Trigger does this internally. Using also quotes inside --params most probably causes invalid command lines.
#
# "FILES_SAVE" is an optional key defining a path to additional self test log files. The Test Trigger does not require this information,
# but the build process. Because the build process is responsible for collecting all log files, to make them available for users.

# Section "TESTTYPES":
# --------------------
#
# Defines for every test type:
# - the related database executor (as Python module call)
# - the command line of the database executor (except the test log file containing the test results - is considered internally)
# The log file ("LOGFILE") is taken over from setion "COMPONENTS" and must not be defined here!
# A global command line (similar to --robotcommandline and --pytestcommandline) is not available for database executors (only "LOCALCOMMANDLINE").
#
# The key "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is optional; other keys of section "TESTTYPES" are mandatory.
# The meaning of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is: Command line part that is only valid for a certain database access, but not for all database accesses.
# The content of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is a list. Elements of this list can be parameters (${...}).
# Values for parameters that are part of the "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" list, have to be defined in command line of Test Trigger (with --params).
# Example: --params "param1=value1;param2=value2;...". This is optional.
# Parameters of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" that are not defined in command line, are skipped and therefore are not considered for database access.
# Finally (after internally the parameters are resolved) the "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" only contains parameters that are defined in the command line.
# It is assumed that every value inside --params can be a string containing blanks. Nevertheless it is not necessary to encapsulate values in quotes.
# The Test Trigger does this internally. Using also quotes inside --params most probably causes invalid command lines.
#
# The robot2db 'dryrun' mode is activated by --params "dryrun=--dryrun" in command line of Test Trigger.
#
# UUID and append mode are handled Test Trigger internally (the first test result is written 'as new' to database, all follow up results are
# written in append mode).
#
# The "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" of "DATABASEEXECUTOR" defines path and name of a database configuration file (containing the components mapping table)
# in this way: "--config ${dbapp_config}".
# A value for 'dbapp_config' has to be provided in command line of the Test Trigger (--params). In case of the path to 'dbapp_config'
# is a relative one, the Test Trigger converts the relative path to an absolute one internally. The reference is the position
# of the Test Trigger (aio-test-trigger.py).
#
# Database access has to be activated explicitely in command line of Test Trigger by '--results2db'. Otherwise the execution of all
# "DATABASEEXECUTOR" are skipped.
